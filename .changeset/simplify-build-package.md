Simplify the build package to focus on version management utilities:

- Remove CLI implementation and main command
- Keep only check-version and sync-version scripts
- Update documentation to reflect simplified structure
- Reduce dependencies and improve maintainability
- Add publishConfig with public access for proper npm publishing
